### Overview UHPool

### Walkthrough UHPool

UHPool is a meteor app that allows people to find other carpoolers in the UH community. 
When first accessing UHPool, everyone will be greeted by the landing page showing why they should join to use the app and images that show a preview of the app.

### Survey
We used an online survey to find suggestions and our target area for people to use our app @ https://goo.gl/forms/Sn69DvwC8G04OhqN2

So far as of april only 11 particpates filled out the survey and results were quite surprising:
According to the survey, a lot of people didn't know UH Manoa had a carpool system, people would consider giving carpooling a chance and people couldn't think of a solution to find someone to carpool with.

### Milestone 1

For Milestone 1 five mockup pages were created for the project. The goal of milestone 1 was to create mockups of our app using the meteor app. The site allowed people to log in using their UH account however a lot of the functions in the website weren't fully operational. Milestone 1 started on April 5th 2017 and ended on April 13th 2017.
